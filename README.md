# dDocs

## What it is
A very simple PoC for a "docs-only" CMS (think Docusaurus). 
Features: 
- add/remove doc-items (add, remove)
- edit doc-items (update)
- a very simple auth schema for authors and editors (authorize)

## Why build it
It would be great to get some real data concerning memory-use, storage-use, cycle-use and general cost of running a canister. 

In that sense, the idea is to build a canister that can serve a docs website, with initial content based on the [IC docs](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/), then translate each doc-item to another language, say, spanish, and collect before/after processing data (mentioned previously) to get a sense of the cost of doing these operations, in both detail and in general terms.

Of course, the more content we upload and translate, the more processing ops data we can collect (and the more spanish learners can take advantage of, as a side-effect!).

## Who can use this
Any ICP learners: take a look! see if you find anything useful and be sure to join the [ICP.Hub LATAM Discord](https://discord.gg/JEmcUunu) or reach out via X/Twitter at [ICP.Hub - LatAm](https://twitter.com/icphublatam).
