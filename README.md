# dDocs

## What it is
A very simple PoC for a "docs-only" CMS (think Docusaurus). 
Features: 
- add/remove doc-items (add, remove)
- edit doc-items (update)
- a very simple auth schema for authors and editors (authorize)

## Why build it
It would be great to get some real data concerning memory-use, storage-use, cycle-use and general cost of running a canister. 
In that sense, the idea is to build a canister that can serve a docs website, initially set to part of the docs of IC,
then edit each doc-item to another language, say, spanish, and collect before/after processing data (mentioned previously) to get a sense
of the cost of doing these operations, both detailed and in general terms.
